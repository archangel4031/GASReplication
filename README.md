# GASReplication
###### Description:
This is the source code for the Tutorial Series [UE4 Gameplay Ability System Practical Examples](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLeEXbS_TaXrAbfoPYSNROqe1fDQfQHTfo).

###### Information:
The code is *almost* complete so you can play around with it and use it as a starting point for your own project. I might be adding more features in the future.
This time I will be adding C++ and Blueprints code **YAY!** So you can find C++ code in ***/Source/*** Folder and Blueprints in ***/Content/GAS*** Folder.
I have also included *DefaultGameplayTags.ini* and *DefaultInput.ini* which can be found in **/Config/** folder so that you do not need to manually add tags and Input Bindiings

###### Note:
Due to free GitHub account limitation, you can find the full project on [Mega Link](https://mega.nz/folder/utBBiR7B#sjifBa9L_ZQDJoq_knHR8w).
